                    For some of the best scenic views of the bay area along with adventurous trail hikes and runs come
                    visit the <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=517">Mount Diablo State Regional Parks District
                    </a>. Many visitors to Mount Diablo head straight for the summit to enjoy the famous view.

                    You can look to the <strong>west</strong>, beyond the Golden Gate Bridge, to the Farallon Islands; 
                    <strong>southeast</strong> to the Jame Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton at 4,213 feet; <strong>
                    south</strong> to Mount Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains at 3,791 feet; <strong>north</strong> 
                    to Mount Saint Helena in the Coast Range at 4,344 feet; and still farther <strong>north</strong> to 
                    Mount Lassen in the Cascades at 10,466 feet. <strong>North</strong> and <strong>east</strong> of Mount
                    Diablo the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers meet to form the twisting waterways of the Delta. To 
                    the <strong>east</strong> beyond California’s great Central Valley, the crest of the Sierra Nevada 
                    seems to float in space.

                    The trails in Mount Diablo State Park and the surrounding open spaces are mostly fire roads, with 
                    some sections of narrow, rocky singletrack thrown in. While some trails pass through forested areas, 
                    the trails primarily pass through rolling grassy hills. The elevations in the park range from around 
                    300' to 3,849' at the summit, and the climbing ranges from moderate to very steep. However, the steep 
                    climbs are definitely worth the effort, as a trip to the summit rewards you with a spectacular view 
                    that extends more than 100 miles in every direction on a clear day.
